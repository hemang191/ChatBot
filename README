DOUBT --> 
why we created server using http

Need  more practice on socket programming....


Architecture --->

How web sockets work , what are web sockets , how our data is getting transferred ? 

First of all we had three layers in INTERNET protocol suites are 
1. Application layer ( at which we develop our program) 
2. Internet Layer (IP4  , IP6) 
3. Transport Layer [TCP -> used to transfer data in complete form , no lost in data . UDP -> used to transfer video files, where lost in data is possible  ]

HTTP Request/ Response 

It is request response model 
IN HTTP after the initial request is done , server-client communication lost 

Web Sockets --> full duplex bidirectional model 
we need to send the headers once and the connection is set up in real time , they can share data between each other as node to node
